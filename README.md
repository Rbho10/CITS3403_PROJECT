### _Track. Analyze. Improve._

#### Description

**Productivity Tracker** is a web application designed to help students and professionals optimize their learning and productivity by tracking their study/work hours and task goals. Users can input data manually, and the system provides insightful analysis on focus trends, peak productivity times, and areas for improvement. To quickly familiarize yourself with the appâ€™s interface and functionality, launch ProTrack and click the **Learn** button in the top-left corner. The ProTrack Manual will then appear, detailing the purpose and use of each feature.

The dashboard highlights:
- Daily/weekly/monthly study durations
- Subject-wise efficiency
- Personalized productivity trends

This application motivates users by giving them clear visual feedback using OpenAI API integration tool and enables sharing progress with peers or mentors. Simply click **My Friends** to add and view friends, or use **My Subjects** to create new subjects and log productivity sessions for each one. Once done, either view your updated dashboard insights or add another session if there's more you want to track. To share your insights with other ProTrack members, click the arrow icon in the top-right corner of any visualisation container. Updates from the sender will automatically reflect on the receiver's dashboard side, thus receiver will always get the latest change once the sender has selectively selected a user to share their data.

A user.db database has been created to store user's credentials in a secure manner. Passwords are stored in the form of hash (password + salt) in the database.

The code will be stored in a zip folder. Unzipping the folder will decompress the contents of the folder. 

**Steps to reproduce/run the code:**
1. Create and activate a virtual environment by running the command: `python3 -m venv protrackenv` 
Then access the virtual environment On Mac: `source protrackenv/bin/activate` On Windows: `protrackenv\Scripts\activate`
2. Install the dependencies by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up the flask environment by `export FLASK_APP=run:app` then `export FLASK_ENV=development` for development/production (testing with the real user.db database) or `export FLASK_ENV=testing` for testing to run the flask app instance later. In this case, we must use `export FLASK_ENV=development`.
Make sure `python-dotenv` is installed in your virtual environment. This will automatically load the .env file which contains your OpenAI API Key and secret key. This has been safely ignored through .gitignore file so that the key won't be exposed to the public repository.
5. Create an OpenAI Account via https://platform.openai.com/
6. Follow prompts and create an API key by entering API Key Name, and enter a project name. Copy the API Key once generated.
7. Create an empty `.env` file in the project's root directory. Otherwise, use the sample .env file that has been provided for submission.
8. In the `.env` file, paste the line `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...{your api key}`. Also,create a `SECRET_KEY={your secret key}` for taking user input through flask-WTF forms. After these two variables have been inserted, save the file. The `python-dotenv` that has been installed in your virtual environment will automatically treat this as environment variables of the os and will then be used in the respective python codes (i.e. generate_insights.py, addSession.html).
9. Run the application: `flask run`. This will only work if you set up the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to point to your flask application instance.

Note: Sometimes running this the first or second time may result in an error. To fix this, simply close all terminal then create a new one and follow the instructions again from accessing the virtual environment and adding the respective environment variables (step 3). 

**Testing 5 Unit Tests and 5 Selenium Tests.**
1. Make sure that the flask environment is set to `export FLASK_ENV=testing` for this testing purpose.
2. For unit tests, run the command `python3 -m unittest tests/unitTests.py`
3. For Selenium tests, run the command `python3 -m unittest tests.selenium_tests.SeleniumTests`
